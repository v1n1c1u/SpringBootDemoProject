# SpringBootDemoProject

This simple website simulates a company's control system which provides CRUD operations for entities such as departments, employees and their roles!

Hopefully it is a good showcase of my freshly obtained full-stack development skills with SpringBoot and Thymeleaf. Give it a try!

## Observation!

This project is not 100% finished yet, so not all functionalities are working right now... :(

And you might have to have MySQL installed in order to run the program
